          This page demonstrates how to implement a custom page in Datasette.
          Note that you can pass URL path parameters into the actual template
          like we've done here with "{{ slug }}".
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          The plot below is generated using the
          <a
            href="https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot"
            class="text-blue-600 hover:underline"
            >Plot library</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          If you want, you can implement your own custom page in a similar
          manner.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          This can be particularly useful if you want to implement a custom page
          that is not based on just a single table, because you can still access
          the database by making fetch calls against the Datasette API routes!
          So, you could imagine building a custom page that functions like a
          dashboard of sorts, that shows a number of different charts and
          tables, that business stakeholders have requested.
